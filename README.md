# CORS Patch for Internet Archive Downloader

Some users of Internet Archive Downloader extension for Firefox encounter "Cross-Origin Request Blocked" error. The "allow CORS" function had been integrated into the extension, but it does not always work for all Firefox releases on all platforms. The reason is unknown. So come the CORS Patch extension. Or other third party CORS extensions will also be help.
